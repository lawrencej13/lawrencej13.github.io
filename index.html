        <h3>Sky High</h3>
        <p><strong><em>There is nothing like the sky</em></strong><br>Sometimes I just sit there and watch the birds fly<br><strong><em>Sometimes I sit there and get high</em></strong><br>I don't know why<br><strong><em>But when I smoke, I just feel sky high</em></strong></p>
    <p>Imagine being on a cloud<br><strong><em>Without a worry about doubt</em></strong><br>No one with major clout,<br><strong>Here to burn you out</strong></p>
        <p><strong><em>Roll one, Smoke one</em></strong><br>Feeling like the sun<br><strong><em>Don't bring me down,</em></strong><br>I just tryna have fun</p>
