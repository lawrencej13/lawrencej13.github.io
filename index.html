        <h3>Sky High</h3>
        <p>There is nothing like the sky<br>Sometimes I just sit there and watch the birds fly<br>Sometimes I sit there and get high<br>I don't know why<br>But when I smoke, I just feel sky high</p>
        <p>Imagine being on a cloud<br>Without a worry about doubt<br>No one with major clout,<br>Here to burn you out</p>
        <p>Roll one, Smoke one<br>Feeling like the sun<br>Don't bring me down,<br>I just tryna have fun</p>
